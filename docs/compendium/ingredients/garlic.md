Sharp and sulfurous when raw; sweet and mellow when roasted.

## History
An ancient staple in cuisines across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.

## Rules
Control bitterness by keeping heat moderate and timing it after aromatics.

## When to Break
Use raw in dressings for a punchy, lingering finish.

## Pairings
Especially strong with `compendium://ingredient.tomato`,
`compendium://ingredient.olive-oil`, and `compendium://ingredient.onion`.

## Substitutions
If needed, a small amount of `compendium://ingredient.onion` can mimic aroma.

## Notes
Crushing or mincing activates stronger flavor than slicing.
