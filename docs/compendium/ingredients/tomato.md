## Flavor Profile
Bright acidity with balanced sweetness and a savory, lightly green finish.

## History
Originating in the Americas, tomatoes became essential across Mediterranean
and global cuisines once adopted in Europe.

## Rules
Build body by cooking down to reduce water and concentrate flavor.

## When to Break
Use raw tomato for freshness even when a cooked base is common.

## Pairings
Classic partners include `compendium://ingredient.garlic`,
`compendium://ingredient.basil`, and `compendium://ingredient.olive-oil`.

## Substitutions
For cooked dishes, `compendium://ingredient.canned-tomato` works well.
For depth in sauces, a small amount of `compendium://ingredient.tomato-paste`
can stand in.

## Notes
For maximum flavor, balance with salt and fat before increasing sweetness.
